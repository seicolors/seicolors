<h4 id="story">🌟 Story Behind Sei Colors</h4>
<p>
 It all started with a vision to create something that hasn't been done before - capturing the essence of every color in the digital spectrum. A programmer with a passion for blockchain technology and art decided to bring this vision to life. The idea was simple yet profound - create a collection where each color tells its own story, each pixel is a narrative.
</p>

<h4 id="code">💻 The Code: A Symphony of Colors</h4>
<p>
 The heart of "Sei Colors" lies in its code - a concise, 57-line Python script that is nothing short of magical. This script is a choreographed dance of numbers and algorithms, meticulously designed to generate 10,101 NFTs, each featuring a unique color.
</p>

<h4 id="community">🤝 For the Community, By the Community</h4>

This collection isn't just about colors. It's about community, creativity, and sharing a piece of digital artistry. The NFTs are more than just tokens; they're a celebration of the digital palette that paints our screens every day.
